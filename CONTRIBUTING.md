# Website Contributing Guide

Do you want to contribute to Shipwright's documentation, or publish a blog post about Shipwright?
You have come to the right place!

## Before You Begin

- Review the overall project [contributor guide](https://github.com/shipwright-io/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
  and [code of conduct](https://github.com/shipwright-io/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
- Set up your computer to contribute content to the website. Review the "Getting Started" section
  in the [README](README.md) for details.

## Adding Content

There are two main forms of content on the website - documentation and blog posts.

We use the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) framework to generate the website content, which supports
internationalization. At present we publish content only in English, located in the `content/en`
directory.

### Adding Documentation Content

Documentation content can come in various forms, but is directly related to the features and
functionality of Shipwright's projects. This content is located in the `content/en/docs` directory.

API reference documentation - located in `content/en/docs/ref` - should not be edited by hand. This
content should only be generated by running the `gen-api-docs` Makefile target:

```sh
make gen-api-docs
```

### Adding Blog Posts

Blog post content should be located in the `content/en/blog/posts` directory.

Release notes may also be published in the `content/en/blog/releases` directory.
